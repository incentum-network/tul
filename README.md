# Token Use License

The open source landscape is changing rapidly, with more companies adopting a more restricted form of open source licensing. This is due to the fact that large cloud computing companies sell cloud based versions of popular open source software without giving anything to the community, or worse, competing directly with paid versions of open source offered by the community. For example, the [Commons Clause](https://commonsclause.com) has been adopted by several open source companies to restrict commercial use of open source software. 

Projects that require a utility token to access a service present a new and unique model for software developers. However, there are still competing licensing requirements:

1. The license should encourage an open community that is using, enhancing, promoting, and distributing the licensed work.
1. The license must protect and promote the use of the utility token(s).
2. The license must be simple enough to understand and implement.

The Token Use License is designed to satisfy all of these criteria. It is similar to the Apache 2.0 License, but with an additional restriction on redistribution - Derivative Works must abide by a *Token Use Clause* attached to the license.

The *Token Use Clause* describes the definition and requirements for using the utility token(s) included in the licensed work. Usually, using the same token(s) in the same manner as the licensed work will be sufficient for most *Token Use Clauses*, but it is split out into a separate file for cases that might be more complex. We recommend using the name *TUC.md* or *TUC.txt* for the *Token Use Clause*.
