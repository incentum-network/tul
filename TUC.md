### Token Use Clause for Praxis Smart Contracts, Praxis, and Incentum Components

1. The blockchain your are interacting with must:
   1. Be using the PRAX token, or
   2. You must acquire an equivalent amount of PRAX (to the gas fees) from an Incentum supplied source.
2. You cannot modify any of the calculations that determine the gas fees, or that allow access to the gas fee usage.

#### Notes for acquiring PRAX

This gives you the flexibility of not having to use PRAX directly anywhere in your network, as long as you acquire the equivalent amount (to the gas fees) from an Incentum supplied source. It needs to be an Incentum supplied source to prevent wash trading, but the source will calculate the 
price based on public exchange data (when available), or the price will be the current price as set by Incentum.

The exact mechanism for acquiring PRAX is not described here.
