### Token Use Clause

1. If you distribute or use a licensed Work, the Work must be using the official PRAX token.
2. You cannot modify any of the calculations that determine the gas or other fees, unless specifically stated otherwise.
3. Licensed Works that do not include use of the PRAX token cannot be distributed or used alone. They must be distributed or used as a part of a licensed Work that includes usage of the PRAX token.
