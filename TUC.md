### Token Use Clause for Praxis Smart Contracts, Praxis, and Incentum Components

1. If you distribute or utilize a licensed Work:
   1. The Work must be using the official PRAX token, or
   2. You must pay Incentum an amount of PRAX equivalent to the gas or other calculated fees.
2. You cannot modify any of the calculations that determine the gas or other fees, or that allow access to the fee usage.
3. Licensed Works that do not include a fee calculation cannot be distributed alone. They must be distributed as a part of a licensed Work that includes a fee calculation, in which case 1 or 2 above apply.

#### Notes for paying PRAX

This gives you the flexibility of not having to use PRAX directly, as long as you pay the same amount or PRAX (to the gas or other fees) to Incentum. 

The exact mechanism for paying PRAX is not described here, but will either be fully automated, or easy to fully automate.
