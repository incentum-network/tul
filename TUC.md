### Token Use Clause

1. If you reproduce, create, distribute or use a Work licensed under this License, or any Derivative Work, the Work and/or Derivative Work must use, and be required to use, the official PRAX token (as defined below). This clause 1 does not apply where the reproduction is to Your own machines solely for the purposes of testing the Work.
2. In using the Work, or creating any Derivative Work, you may not modify any of the calculations that determine the gas or other fees set out in the Work, unless specifically stated otherwise.
3. Works and Derivative Works that do not use, or are not required to use, the official PRAX token cannot be distributed or used alone, except solely for testing purposes on Your own machines. They must be distributed or used as a part of a Work or Derivative Work that uses, or is required to use, the official PRAX token.
4. You agree to do all things necessary to ensure that all Works and Derivative Works use the official PRAX token.
5. The official PRAX token is the PRAX token on the mainnet started by Incentum Ltd.
